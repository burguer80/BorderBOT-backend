Ruby On Rails application to pull the latest Port Wait Times from the official site [U.S. CBP](https://bwt.cbp.gov/).

# General Information
**Requirements**:
- Ruby 2.7.0
- Rails 6+
- PostgreSQL
- Redis

- This project is over-engineering ***for Learning/Experimentation purposes***. 
- Data is stored in a Redis DB.
- Data persistence was removed temporary due the code refactoring it will be implemented once the front-end is finished. (to save üíµ)


**Future Plans**:
- Add wait time predictions
- Remove outdated logic that is not longer used
- Deploy the application to a better deployment infrastructure with no restrictions.
